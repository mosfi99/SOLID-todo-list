# TaskIt âœ…

TaskIt is a responsive Todo Web App built as part of [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list#project-solution).
The projectâ€™s main goal was to practice JavaScript ES6+ classes, modules, and apply SOLID principles.

## Overview

The app is structured around three core logic classes, `Task`, `Space` and `TaskManager`. A separate `Dom` class handles all user interface interactions.

My goal was to focus more on **modularity, encapsulation, and clean architecture**, aiming to follow SOLID principles, especially the Single Responsibility Principle,while learning how to translate them into practical code.

## Learning experience

This was my first project using JS classes. I plan to revisit this project after building more applications with these patterns.

## Tech stack

- JavaScript ES6+ Classes and Modules
- Webpack
- Tailwind CSS (with DaisyUI Components)

## Future Plans

- Continue practicing the concepts learned
- Build additional projects to strengthen understanding
- Return to refactor this project with improved skills
